# Simple Modal

I wanted to create a custom modal window to welcome new users to a company teams subscription plan.

### General Info

* A modal window is commonly used when the author wants to retain the user's focus on the information. It forces the user to interact with it before they can go back to using the application.
* A Click here button to open the modal
* Simple header, icon, body text and footer links
* The ability for the user to close the modal by clicking the (x) or by clicking anywhere outside of the modal box.

### Technologies

Project is created with:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript

### What I Learnt

* How to make a function to hide the modal when the page loads and then a function that is going to display it.
* Using document methods to return an element object representing the element who id property matches the specified string.
* Add an event listener to the modal button. When the user clicks on the button it opens the modal.
* Create a function to open modal by setting the modals style display property to block.
* Add an event listener to the window object to close the modal. Making an if statement to see if the parameter target is equal to modal, if true the modal will be hidden.
